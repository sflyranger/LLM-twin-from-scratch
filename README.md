# LLM-twin-from-scratch
My Version of the LLM Engineers Handbook, I chose to make my own instead of forking because I wanted to code all of the files from scratch to gain a more in depth understanding of the underlying processes for the model.

One major thing I learned in grad school is that to truly understand something you have to do it, not just read about it. While I have read through most of the LLM Engineers Handbok already, I felt that I was lacking in understanding of some of the files and how they operate within the FTI pipeline framework. That is why I set up this repository. While many of the files I will be coding here will be very similar or at times exactly like the files from the LLM Engineers Handbook Repo, I will be making modifications when necessary to fit my needs while extensively documenting the process. 

The goal is to create my own LLM Twin chatbot and deploy it as an example on the Huggingface platform so that others can view my work and as a proof of concept to future employers. The LLM Twin creation process will broaden my knowledge base of how to fully enact a model of my own that can be scaled to production. It is important to note that I have limited resources for future scaling so this project may never get that far, but the goal is not to use this model personally. I want to learn and broaden my knowledge. Let's get started.
